# Live Cartoonize

Cartoonize your own video through the input from the video camera. OpenCV is used to capture the video frames and these are then processed through internal layers to create a cartoonish avatar of your frame. This cartoonish avatar is created multiple times per second (FPS depends on the compute capability of Run Environment)
